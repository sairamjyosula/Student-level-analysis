# Student level analysis
An online tuition provider for classes 6-10 has recently conducted an examination for its students, and the subsequent sheets contain the results for each subject.
Each student of a class has been assigned a unique roll number.
There is no restriction on how many subjects each student can enroll in, he/she can take only 1, or take all 5.
Each assignment is of 100 marks, be it theory, numerical, or practical. Total marks should be considered for each subject.

Currently the information for each subject is scattered across subject databases and the tuition provider wants to do a student-level analysis across all subjects and classes.
The following will be the tasks involved in this assignment:

1. Create a python code (.py file only) which reads the entire data and returns a table which contains all the unique students enrolled with the tuition provider in rows, and the % Marks
he/she has obtained in each subject in columns. In case the student is not enrolled in a particular subject, the entry for that student should show "NA" for the particular subject

2. After creating the table, write python codes to obtain the following:
- How many students in total are enrolled with the tuition provider?
- How many students have taken all the five subjects?
- Which class has the most number of students?
- Which class has the highest average percentage of marks across all subjects?
- Which subject has the highest average percentage of marks across all classes?
